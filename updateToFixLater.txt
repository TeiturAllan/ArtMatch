currently users can only update their profile picture by providing a link to the desired image, later itterations will have to enable users
to upload images themselves aswell as allowing users to simply provide a link.

currently the updateProfile function fires every time a letter is changed in either of the text boxes, this needs to be updated, so that it only fires when the
"update user" button is pressed.
also the changes are saved into firebase straight away, but it is not updated in the apps memory, and therefor the change is only visible after relaunching the app/signing inn again
